Final Project

The program asks users to answer questions to print patient information according to users' input as follows:

1.Fullname
2.Weight
3.Height
4.Blood pressure condition
5.BMI
6.BMI status

The project consists of 2 program files, Program.cs and Patient.cs written in C#.
Program.cs is the entry point to get user input and then call the methods in Patient.cs. 
Patient.cs is a blueprint to generate a patient as object with 4 fields along with properties, 1 constructor and 3 methods.

The first method return 5 different string messages based on blood pressure levels (systolic and diastolic). 
The second method calculates BMI based on height and weight.
The third method print the patient information.
